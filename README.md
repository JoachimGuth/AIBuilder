# AI Builder final Project
Final project proposal for the AI course of the University of Helsinki


# Idea in a nutshell
The stores of a bakery chain with a central bakery experiences sometimes oversupply, sometimes lack of baking goodsin the stores when needed. The idea is to optimise the distribution of goods to avoid a lack of goods and leftovers in the stores.


# Background
What is the problem your idea will solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

There are 2 main problems for the bakery chain. 
## Revenue loss
Sometimes goods could be sold at one bakery store but the particular good is not available, whereas the respective good is available in another store. The bakery chain experiences a loss of revenue.

## Leftovers
Some stores experiences leftovers after the store is closing for the day whereas another store could have sold it if those goods would have been available.

This problem exist almost every day. 

## Cost and Speed of goods distribution







# Data and AI techniques:
What data sources does your project depend on? Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential. Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful? Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data!


# How is it used

A good solution might affect various parties, especially the owner of the bakery chain should experience some cost reduction as lesss resources would be required and wasted. On top of that more revenue would lead to a higher income. 

## Owner of the Bakery Chain

## Store Manager/Employees

## Customer

## Delivery Service




What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom? Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected.

# Challenges: 
What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.
What next: How could your project grow and become something even more?
