# AIBuilder final Project
Final project proposal for the AI course of the University of Helsinki


# Idea in a nutshell: 
A bakery chain with a central bakery and many stores experiences sometimes oversupply, sometimes lack of baking goods inthe stores.
The idea is to optimise the supply to avoid lack of goods and leftovers in the etores.


# Background: 
What is the problem your idea will solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?


# Data and AI techniques:
What data sources does your project depend on? Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential. Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful? Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data!


# How is it used:
What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom? Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected.

# Challenges: 
What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.
What next: How could your project grow and become something even more?


# Acknowledgments:
